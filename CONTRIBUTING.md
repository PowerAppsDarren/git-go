### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes: `./tests/test.sh`
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style
5. Write a clear commit message

## Development Setup

git checkout -b my-feature

# Make your changes
# ...

# Run tests
./tests/test.sh

```

## Style Guidelines

### Shell Script Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Always quote variables: `"$var"` not `$var`
- Use `[[ ]]` for conditionals, not `[ ]`
- Functions should be lowercase with underscores
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

## Testing

All new features should include tests. Run the test suite with:

```bash
./tests/test.sh
```
