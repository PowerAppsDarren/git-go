# Resume Old Chats and Document Them

This is intended for developer users, not AI. It allows us devs to pull up old chats and document them here in ai-chats. 

## Use this as a template

- This is a chat brought up by using the /resume command, and it is a continuation of a previous chat.
- So, this session started at ___ on 2025-08-___
- What was the purpose of this chat?
- What was the overall goal of this chat?
- What was the actual outcome of this chat?
- Any open cycles of action that were never compelted or resolved? 
- What was the next planned step?
- What was the next action?
- Document all this by reading and following the instructions found in @ai-chats/README.md
- If CLAUDE.md is not found in the project root, create it and add instructions to it to follow the @ai-chats/README.mdd instructions
