# AI Chat Session: 2025-08-08-01 - Performance Optimization

## Session Overview
**Date**: August 8, 2025
**Topic**: Git-Go Performance Optimization and Feature Enhancement
**Claude Instance**: Claude Code (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)

## Session Start
- User opened git-go project
- AI chat documentation enforcement hook triggered - no documentation existed for today
- Creating this documentation file to comply with CLAUDE.md requirements

## Initial State
- Branch: feature/optimize-performance
- Modified files pending:
  - bin/git-go
  - config/git-go.conf.example
  - roadmap.md
  - Deleted old files: gogo, gogo-global
  - New files: gogo.sh, gogo-global.sh
- Recent commits show optimization work and Electron app integration

## Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Added DEFAULT_PARENT_DIR configuration option to config example file
2. ✅ Modified cmd_new() function to interactively ask for parent directory
3. ✅ Modified cmd_fork() function to interactively ask for parent directory  
4. ✅ Updated setup wizard to ask for default parent directory
5. ✅ Tested changes - deployment successful, all tests pass

## Technical Details

### Problem Identified
The git-go tool was creating repositories without asking where to place them, defaulting to a hardcoded `~/src` directory. This could lead to repositories being created in unintended locations.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Configuration Enhancement**: Added `DEFAULT_PARENT_DIR` to the config file to allow users to set their preferred default location
2. **Interactive Prompts**: Both `cmd_new()` and `cmd_fork()` now ask users where to create/clone the repository
3. **Directory Creation**: If the specified parent directory doesn't exist, the script asks permission to create it
4. **Tilde Expansion**: Properly handles `~` in directory paths
5. **Setup Wizard Update**: The initial setup now asks for the default parent directory preference

### Code Changes
- **config/git-go.conf.example**: Added DEFAULT_PARENT_DIR setting with documentation
- **bin/git-go**:
  - Added DEFAULT_PARENT_DIR to default configuration loading
  - Modified WORK_DIR to respect DEFAULT_PARENT_DIR from config
  - Enhanced cmd_new() with parent directory prompt and creation logic
  - Enhanced cmd_fork() with parent directory prompt and creation logic
  - Updated setup wizard to include parent directory configuration

## Conversation Summary
User reported a critical issue where git-go needed better control over where repositories are created. They requested:
- A config file setting for default parent directory (defaulting to ~/src)
- Interactive prompts asking where to place new/forked repos
- Ability to create parent directories if they don't exist

All requested features have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a `--parent-dir` flag as an alternative to `-d/--dir` for clarity
- Could add validation to ensure parent directory is writable
- Might want to remember last used parent directory for the session
